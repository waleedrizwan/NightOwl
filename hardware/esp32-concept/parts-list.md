> **Superseded (2026-10-04).** This ESP32 build was the first concept for the bedside device and was never built. Night Owl is now a Raspberry Pi 3 that records audio, with analysis on the Mac: see the [README](../../README.md). The model and data plan here still apply.

## Wiring

- Verified free header pins with the Sense board on: D0-D7 = GPIO1,2,3,4,5,6,43,44. Taken: D8/D9/D10 = SD SCK/MISO/MOSI (GPIO7/8/9), GPIO21 = SD CS + onboard LED, GPIO41/42 = mic. Sources: https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_pin_multiplexing/ and Seeed schematic.
- Use only D0 (GPIO1), D1 (GPIO2), D3 (GPIO4). Leave D2 (GPIO3) empty: strapping pin and also routed to the Sense connector. Leave D6 (GPIO43) empty: prints boot log. Keep D4/D5 free for I2C later.
- Switch SLW-178562-3A-S-D: 4 pins in a line. Name them P1 P2 P3 (close together) and P4 (alone after the gap). Put them in 4 separate breadboard rows: n, n+1, n+2, n+4. Bend up or snip the 2 frame tabs first.
- P3 = common (per datasheet schematic) -> XIAO GND. P1 -> D0 (GPIO1). P4 -> D1 (GPIO2). P2 -> nothing.
- Firmware: pinMode(INPUT_PULLUP) on D0 and D1. D0 LOW = slider at P1 end = OFF. Both HIGH = middle = AUTO. D1 LOW = slider at P4 end = ON. Debounce ~50 ms. A broken wire reads as AUTO.
- Test once with Serial.print. If the middle and one end read the same, the GND wire is on the wrong pin; move it to the pin next to the gap.
- LED: D3 (GPIO4) -> 10k resistor -> LED long leg. LED short leg -> XIAO GND. About 0.13 mA. Dim more with PWM (ledcAttach / ledcWrite) or blink briefly.
- Power comes from USB-C only. Nothing connects to the 5V or 3V3 pins.
- Fallback with two EG1218 switches: each middle pin -> GND. Switch A end pin -> D0 (LOW = OFF). Switch B end pin -> D1 (LOW = force ON). Both HIGH = AUTO. Other end pins unused.

## Gotchas

- Soldering: the in-stock DigiKey board needs 14 header pins soldered. Solder before clipping the Sense board on. True no-solder = pre-soldered SKU 102010635 from Seeed.
- Antenna is mandatory. The board has only a U.FL connector, no onboard antenna (schematic). Seeed: without it 'you may not be able to use the Bluetooth feature'. Press one edge in first; never pull it straight off. https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_bluetooth/
- Onboard yellow LED shares GPIO21 with SD chip-select and is active-low, so expect it to flicker on SD writes. Cover it with tape. The red charge LED turns off 30 s after plug-in when no battery is attached.
- microSD: 32GB max, FAT32. If it fails to mount, do a full (not quick) format with SD Card Formatter. https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_sense_filesystem/
- Before it goes in the bedroom: unplug the camera and flash your own firmware. Factory firmware runs a webcam and a Wi-Fi AP (SSID XIAO_ESP32S3_Sense, password seeedstudio). Slide the Sense board off sideways; never pry it up. Test mic + SD with the camera unplugged on day one (expected to work from the schematic, not stated by Seeed).
- Firmware traps: mic is stable only at 16 kHz/16-bit mono; Arduino core 3.x uses ESP_I2S.h with setPinsPdmRx(42, 41); enable OPI PSRAM. Do not fit the heat sink on a breadboard: it sits under the board and stops it seating. https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_sense_mic/

## Corrections made during fact-check

- Switch wiring was under-specified. Datasheet schematic shows the common is the 3rd pin (at 5.0 mm, next to the gap), not an end pin. Throws are pins 1, 2, 4. GND on an end pin makes two positions read the same. Fixed in wiring.
- Claim 'both inputs can read low mid-slide' is wrong: the unused middle throw sits between the two wired throws. Debounce anyway.
- Switch fit caveat added: pitch matches a breadboard (0/2.5/5/10 mm, verified on the drawing) but pins are only ~3 mm long and 0.5 x 0.4 mm flat, and the 2 frame tabs do not line up. Added Adafruit 805 x2 as same-order fallback.
- Dropped E-Switch EG2301 (researcher 3's pick): pin pitch could not be verified by anyone.
- SD pin map in researcher 2 was wrong. Correct per Seeed wiki: GPIO7 = SCK, GPIO8 = MISO, GPIO9 = MOSI, GPIO21 = CS.
- Charge LED was marked unverified/may blink. Seeed wiki for the S3: with no battery the red light comes on at plug-in and goes off after 30 seconds.
- USB-C CC resistors were marked unverified by researcher 3. I read Seeed's schematic: R1 and R2 are 5.1K on CC1/CC2, so USB-C to USB-C chargers will power it.
- Advice to stick on the heat sink is wrong for a breadboard. It mounts on the underside and the stock headers are too short to seat with it (Seeed forum). Skip it; no camera means little heat. https://forum.seeedstudio.com/t/extended-height-breadboard-headers-for-seeed-studio-xiao-esp32s3-with-xiao-heatsink-installed/283867
- New finding: D2 (GPIO3) is also routed to the Sense board connector as an alternate SD CS (R11 unpopulated). Second reason to leave D2 unused. Schematic + https://forum.seeedstudio.com/t/xiao-esp32s3-sense-spi-sd-card-pin-schematic-error/284934
- D6/D7 are not needed for the serial console. The XIAO S3 uses native USB (no USB-UART chip on the schematic). They are free; only D6 (GPIO43) prints ROM boot text.
- Headers in the box: researchers disagreed and Seeed's product page did not show a part list to me. A forum user mentions kit-provided headers. Treated as likely; added a $1.80 header strip as insurance.
- Bad or stale links replaced: Canada Computers iCAN charger URL returns 404; iCAN USB-C cable is sold out online; Adafruit 758 jumpers are out of stock at DigiKey.ca. Charger and cable moved to optional (use what you own).
- Consolidated small parts onto one DigiKey.ca order. Splitting across Canada Robotix / BC Robotics / PiShop adds a second shipping charge for about $10 of parts.
- Dropped for a first prototype: DS3231 RTC, external I2S mic, RGB LED, resistor kit, card reader, project box, full-size breadboard.
